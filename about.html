    <!-- BACKGROUND -->
    <section class="card">
      <h3>Background</h3>

      <p>
        Rumah Permata Camar was initiated by Badan Nadwah Islamiah Pahang (NADWAH)
        in 2002 as part of its welfare-based outreach programme known as
        <em>dakwah bil hal</em>. The home officially began its operations on
        28 February 2004 with only five children housed in rented semi-detached
        homes in Kuantan, Pahang.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through continuous public support, donations, and land endowments,
        Rumah Permata Camar has grown steadily. In 2014, the organisation was
        officially registered as an independent welfare body, allowing more
        structured administration and effective management.
